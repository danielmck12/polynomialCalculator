# Polynomial Factorisation Calculator

This application is designed to, 
- Take in an expression, this is done by asking the user for a series of coeficcients
- The program then identifies the degree of polynomial entered and uses the appropriate method to factorise
- It should work for polynomials of degree less than or equal to 4
